# Data Analysis with Python Projects

Hey there! Welcome to my "Data Analysis with Python" projects repository. This is from the freeCodeCamp course, and I've put together a bunch of projects here. You'll find different techniques for analyzing data using Python, along with some popular libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib. Enjoy exploring and learning!


## Projects:

1. **Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator**
   - Description: A calculator that computes the mean, variance, and standard deviation.

2. **Demographic Data Analyzer**
   - Description: Analyze demographic data using pandas.

3. **Medical Data Visualizer**
   - Description: Visualize medical examination data using seaborn.
  
4. **Page View Time Series Visualizer**
   - Description: Visualize time series data of page views on a website.

5. **Sea Level Predictor**
   - Description: Predict the future sea level rise using linear regression.

## How to Use:

Each project is contained within its own directory. You can explore the code and run the scripts as needed.

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash

pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib
```
## Getting Started:

To get started with any project, simply navigate to its directory and run the corresponding Python script.
